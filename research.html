            A programming language is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">formal language </a>,
            which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used
            in computer programming to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>.

            Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a
            set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention
            of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by
            the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have been
            used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2] The
            programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in
            response to different inputs or conditions.

            Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many
            programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while
            other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

            The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> (form) and semantics
            (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language
            is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation">implementation</a> that is
            treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and
            extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common

                <b>From Source Code to Machine Language</b><br>
                The statements written by the programmer are called "source code," which are translated into the
                computer's "machine language" by programs called "assemblers," "compilers" and "interpreters." For
                example, when a programmer writes ADD A TO B, ADD is turned into machine code for add, and A and B are
                the locations in RAM where the two amounts are temporarily stored.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Grammar and Syntax</b><br>
                Like human languages, each programming language has its own grammar and syntax, and there can be
                dialects, each requiring its own assemblers and compilers. Standards have been set by ANSI for many
                languages. However, it can take a long time for new features to be standardized, and new dialects spring
                up all the time. See <a href="/encyclopedia/term/program-logic">program logic</a>.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Assemblers, Compilers and Interpreters</b><br>
                For each CPU hardware platform, there is a low-level assembly language that generates machine language
                one for one. High-level languages (what most programmers write in) use compilers that generate many
                machine instructions for each source code statement the programmer writes (see <a
                    href="/encyclopedia/term/compiler">compiler</a>). There are also programming languages that are
                translated into machine language one statement at a time each time they run (see <a
                    href="/encyclopedia/term/interpreter">interpreter</a>).<br>

        <h2 style="padding: 0 0 15px 15px;">The Importance of Computer Programming</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #333; padding-left: 25px;">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color:green">&#8220;</span>
            Programming language is important because it defines the relationship, semantics and grammar which allows
            the programmers to effectively communicate with the machines that they program.

            A programming language serves several purposes:

            You can instruct the computer what to do in a human-readable form
            Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc.
            This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" which can be developed by a group of developers

            Provides portability - the low-level instructions of one computer will be different from that of another
            computer.


            Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system
            limitations, and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use
            of the equipment and its accessories.

            Programming, especially in web development, has allowed new interactive web applications that have access to
            system resources and provide the same level of control as desktop applications. Used on online learning
            platforms, these applications have allowed distance-learning programs to take off. Today, almost all major
            learning institutions have some form of online learning implementation, thanks to computer programming.

            Computer programming principles implemented today will likely influence how technologies such as
            voice-recognition, artificial intelligence and other sophisticated technologies will change in the future
            and how they will be applied to our day-to-day lives. For example, the trend toward automating Internet
            searches and purchases to be more localized is ongoing. While the hardware platforms developed will play a
            major role, computer technology will likely be at the center of it all and programming future systems will
            be an important aspect.

            Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system
            limitations, and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use
            of the equipment and its accessories.

            No matter what type of job a computer programmer fulfills, he/she will have general responsibilities to
            perform in their role as computer programmer. The first is to develop new computer programming methods.
            These may include anywhere from basic computer programming methods to more in-depth methods. Another general
            responsibility which a computer programmer must undertake in his/her daily job role is the development of
            programs themselves. This is an extremely important concept associated with the role of a computer
            programmer as these are the individuals who construct the useful programs which are used by many.

            Another general responsibility of a computer programmer is to consult with outside parties in relation to
            the construction of computer programming methods and the programs themselves. Lastly, computer programmers
            must follow the progress of programs to ensure that they are operating correctly and fix any program errors
            that might occur along the way.

            First thing what is computer programming? It’s nothing but a sequence of instructions to enable the computer
            to do something. It does because if you are working in IT Company (after your graduation) then the thing
            which matters is: "How can you save the efforts of other people (Customers) so that they will reward you".
            You can do this only if you automate the process which individual have to perform manually. This can be done
            by programming only.

            So what you are thinking. It’s still unclear to you.

            Knowledge of computer programming habituates your mind to thinking in a sensible, common sense manner and
            that approach will benefit anyone in the information technology field. The ability to think rationally and
            use logic when making decisions in.

            Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a
            mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or
            two, and the computer does something. An example would be to get weather information from the net and
            display it. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know.

            But, since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you need to know a little bit about how a
            computer works. Your job will be to instruct the computer to do things. Basically, writing software
            (computer programs) is describing how to do something. In its simplest form, it is a lot like writing down
            the steps it takes to do something - a process, a procedure. The lists of instructions that you will write
            are computer programs, and the stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects,
            e.g., numbers, words, graphics, etc…

            So, writing a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of
            stuff. It has been argued that in its current state it is an art, not engineering.

            An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying
            this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it. One thing
            that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb but obedient. It does exactly what you tell it
            to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted. Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity
            of expression.

            The logic is generally the most difficult part of programming. However, depending on the programming
            language, writing the statements may also be laborious. One thing is certain. Documenting the program is
            considered the most annoying activity by most programmers.

            Computers are extremely important in the modern world of today. In the fast moving life of the modern world
            of today, computers hold tremendous significance. Many of us will feel crippled without a computer, as we
            have gotten so used to this machine. The importance of computers can not be denied in the corporate or
            business world, at the work place and even in one's personal life.

            Computer programming as of now is very important because it is part of our daily living even you like it or
            not. That is the truth just of my own observation that most likely happening in this new world.

        <h2 style="padding: 0 0 15px 15px;">Top ten programming techniques.</h2>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #333; padding-left: 25px;">
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color:green">&#8220;</span>
                There’s been a lot of debate about which programming language is best for teaching students to program,
                but, ultimately, it doesn't matter. Learning to program isn’t about syntax, it’s about the algorithmic
                thinking.&nbsp; It isn’t about learning the commands from <em>Codecademy</em>, it’s about breaking down
                a larger task into a number of codable steps.&nbsp; That's why I don't like the term "coding" - it's not
                what we're trying to teach.</p>

            <p>Cognitive scientists tell us that we learn and remember the things we think about.&nbsp; We need to make
                sure that our lessons get students to think about what we actually want them to learn.&nbsp; That’s why
                word searches have no educational value (other than for teaching students to spell) - they make students
                think about what the words look like, rather than what they mean.</p>

            <p>I wouldn't, therefore, start students off with exercises on spotting syntax errors in existing
                code.&nbsp; It's not very exciting, and it also seems somewhat back-to-front – like getting
                primary-school children to proofread novels.&nbsp; More crucially, it’s getting students to think about
                the not-very-important issue of syntax (which they can look up if they need to) when they should be
                thinking about the programming techniques and the steps required to create the program.</p>

            <p>With that in mind, I’m going to tell you about my top ten language-independent programming techniques –
                almost all will work in any language. I think they form a good basis for a <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/tasks.html"><strong>KS3 programming
                        course</strong></a> - you can add examples in your chosen language to illustrate the ideas, and
                maybe use the list as a checklist of things to try when approaching a new programming task.</p>

            <p>Naturally, a list of the most fundamental techniques will contain a few really obvious ones, which I
                won’t need to describe in detail. I might expand on some of the more complex ideas in the coming months
                if I feel that there's a need.</p>

            <p><strong>1. Variables</strong></p>

            <p>You’re unlikely to be able to create a useful or interesting program that doesn’t store any information -
                you wouldn't want to play a game that couldn't give you a score, for example. <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/variables.html">Variables</a>, therefore, are
                probably <em>the</em> most important thing in programming.&nbsp; The number of <em>types</em>, and
                whether you need to <em>declare</em> them varies from language to language, which is why I start with
                <em>Just Basic</em> (with just two types – numbers and strings) and progress to <em>Visual Basic</em>
                (with more types, but essentially the same commands).</p>

            <p><strong>2. Repetition/Loops</strong></p>

            <p>This list isn’t ordered, but I think that loops are probably the second-most important construct in
                programming.</p>

            <p><em>For</em> is by far the most common form of <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/flow.html">repetition</a> in my own programs,
                although I find that self-taught students tend to be obsessed with using <em>while</em> for everything -
                I'm not sure why, as in most cases it creates a more complex solution.&nbsp; In the majority of
                &nbsp;languages, <em>for</em> uses the idea of counting, although in Python it iterates through a list
                or string, and in JavaScript it can be used to loop through a “collection” of objects on a page in a
                similar way.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Decisions/Selection</strong></p>

            <p>A program that does the same thing every time wouldn’t be very engaging or flexible, so we need to get
                our programs to react to user input and other events.&nbsp; As well as the almost-universal <em>if…
                    then… else</em> construct, most programming languages (but not Python) have some sort of <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/flow.html#branching"><strong>case/select</strong></a>
                method for controlling program flow.&nbsp; You can also use array/list indexes as a form of selection
                (see below).</p>

            <p><strong>4. Arrays</strong></p>

            <p>Arrays are useful for collections of like items, e.g. <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/javascript/lottery.html">lottery balls</a>, but using indexes as
                a form of selection or look-up is also a useful technique.&nbsp; For example, we can only create <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/random.html">random numbers</a>, so if we want a
                random thing, such as a day of the week, we can use the random number as the index in an array of
                strings containing the names of the days.</p>

            <p>Python doesn’t have native support for arrays, but some of their functionality can be replicated using
                lists or tuples.&nbsp; Sparsely-populated arrays, or implementing a binary tree in an array, can be a
                bit messy, however, as are two-dimensional arrays.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I’m a big fan of JavaScript, but that also doesn’t support multi-dimensional arrays.&nbsp; What
                JavaScript does allow, though, which can be useful, is having <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> as the
                array index – I used that technique on <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/binary.html">my
                    binary page</a>.&nbsp; It means that can you can use an expression that evaluates as <em>true</em>
                or <em>false</em> as an index, making a form of <a
                    href="https://www.tes.com/news/blog/programming-using-arrays-selection">selection without
                    <em>if</em>s</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Boolean Logic</strong></p>

            <p>Students need to learn about<strong> <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/boolean.html">AND,
                        OR, NOT</a></strong>, etc. for combining truth values, and how to create <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/logic.html">truth tables</a>, for the theory paper,
                but Boolean operators are used all of the time in programming.</p>

            <p>An important thing for students to understand is that all expressions (e.g. equalities or inequalities)
                are evaluated as <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, so <em>if</em>, for example, always operates on
                <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.&nbsp; This means that we can use syntax such as <em>if x…</em> rather
                than <em>if x == true</em>, but also that expressions such as <em>x + 10 == 20</em> or <em>x % 5 &gt;
                    0</em> will be evaluated as either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, and can even be used as array
                indexes in languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <p><strong>6. Bitwise Logic</strong></p>

            <p>Using <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/bitwise.html">bitwise</a> logic to set/unset and
                mask bits was something of a programming staple when I was a teenager and memory was at a premium.&nbsp;
                It could be used to combine multiple values into <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/flags.html">binary flags</a> to save memory and to <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/bitwise.html">mask bits</a> to read them back
                again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dijkstra predicted (in 1979) that “the advent of cheap and powerful devices will set computer science
                back 25 years”. &nbsp;The need to save memory has largely passed, but this is still a useful technique
                for combining multiple values to pass between functions as a single argument, or to pass variable
                numbers of values between web-pages in a cookie or querystring.&nbsp; You can also use it as a quick and
                simple way to convert between denary and binary, or to encipher text like a Lorenz machine using bitwise
                EOR.</p>

            <p><strong>7. Modular Arithmetic</strong></p>

            <p>This was <a
                    href="https://www.tes.com/news/blog/remember-remainders-why-you-should-know-about-modular-arithmetic"
                    target="_blank">the subject of a previous blog</a>, but, briefly, modular arithmetic is dividing and
                looking at the remainder.&nbsp; It’s a good way of limiting the number of outputs of a program or
                function or of getting things to “wrap around”, e.g. getting <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/angles.html">angles</a> to go from 359 back to
                0.&nbsp; It’s so simple and so useful a technique that I can’t think why you wouldn’t include it in any
                KS3 programming course.</p>

            <p><strong>8. Manipulating Text</strong></p>

            <p>I’ve cheated here slightly by combining the manipulation of characters and strings.&nbsp; They’re really
                different things, but I wanted to sneak in trigonometry at number ten!</p>

            <p>The internal representation of data is <a
                    href="https://www.tes.com/news/blog/representation-data-links-whole-computing">the topic that links
                    Computing together</a>, so students should already be aware that text is stored as numbers.&nbsp;
                Being able to <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/ascii.html">convert characters to
                    ASCII</a> and vice versa is a useful technique for a variety of reasons - you can use it to check
                for upper/lower case, for example, or non-alphabetic characters, and you can also use ASCII codes to
                create <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/substitution.html">Caesar shift ciphers</a> or
                Lorenz-style ciphers using bitwise EOR.</p>

            <p>Chopping up strings, e.g. using <em>left()</em> and <em>right()</em> in BASIC, or string-slicing in
                Python, is also useful for a variety of tasks from displaying initials (given a name) to creating
                anagrams.&nbsp; Displaying text in different forms, e.g. changing case for use in headings, is also
                something that you might want to do regularly to improve the appearance of your program (I find that you
                can often spot a confident programmer because they go beyond the coding and refine the user interface of
                their program).</p>

            <p><strong>9. Random Numbers and Scaling</strong></p>

            <p>Some languages, such as Python, have library functions to create random integers (i.e.
                <em>randint()</em>), but you might be using a language that doesn’t, or you might not want an integer,
                so it’s useful to learn <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/random.html">how to scale
                    random numbers</a> yourself.&nbsp; In fact, scaling numbers generally – e.g. for fitting things on a
                screen – is a useful skill in itself.&nbsp; I demonstrate that technique in my <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10924086/">Scratch polygon program</a> to ensure that the
                polygon is always approximately the same size regardless of the number of sides.</p>

            <p>You might want a random number for its own sake, e.g. to simulate a die roll, or to use as an array/list
                index to pick a random thing, but you can also add a degree of randomness to things to make them look
                more “natural”.&nbsp; For example, I used <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/recursion.html">recursion</a> to make <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10924265/">a tree in Scratch</a>, but it didn’t look like a
                real tree.&nbsp; Adding a small amount of randomness creates <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10926866/">a more natural-looking result</a>.</p>

            <p>Python’s <em>randint()</em> function and <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/interactive/random.html">the scaling method I describe</a> create
                pseudorandom numbers that are uniformly distributed throughout the chosen range.&nbsp; You might not
                always want that to be the case.&nbsp; On my <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/angles.html">angles page</a>, for example, I wanted
                smaller angles to be chosen more often than larger ones, because most angles that students encounter are
                less than 180º.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The solution is surprisingly simple; because the random function in most languages generates a number
                between 0 and 1, if you raise that number to any power it stays between 0 and 1, but the distribution
                changes.&nbsp; If you square the number, for example, 0 stays as 0 and 1 remains 1, but 0.5 becomes 0.25
                – i.e. the distribution is skewed towards the lower numbers.&nbsp; You need to do that before
                scaling.&nbsp; If you want to skew the distribution upwards, simply subtract the result from 1.</p>

            <p><strong>10. Trigonometry</strong></p>

            <p>I almost went with “Maths” for this last point, because understanding mechanics topics, such as
                conservation of momentum or Newton’s equations of motion, can be useful, especially when creating games
                or animation.&nbsp; “Maths” might be a bit broad, though, so I’ve chosen trigonometry because, although
                I don’t use it every day, it is the more advanced mathematical technique that I use most often.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/trigonometry.html">Sines and cosines</a> are useful
                when <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/circles.html">drawing circles</a>, <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11439426/">creating circular motion</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/html/rotation.html">laying out items on a page</a>, <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76419010/">creating patterns</a>, and also for working out
                the <a href="http://www.advanced-ict.info/mathematics/angles.html">angles of lines</a> and direction of
                motion.&nbsp; As the trigonometric functions are computationally quite complex, they can also be used in
                discussions of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3sudomTPJA">programming efficiency</a>.</p>

            <p>You might disagree with some of the techniques I’ve included in my list, or you might have others that
                you’d want to include (functions and procedures are important, for example, but I didn’t include them
                because you need to first have some techniques to use in those functions and procedures), so why not
                join us in the <em>TES Community</em> to debate the topic (or create a thread in your own forum of
                choice)?
