            A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of directions that is
            used to deliver different kinds of output. Programming languages unremarkably
            contains of instructions for a Computer. It can be used to create programs that
            implement particular algorithms. There are programmable machines that use a
            limited set of definite directions, instead of the general programming languages of
            trendy computers. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computers the first
            probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers
            Musa in Baghdad, throughout the Islamic golden age. From the early 1800s, programs
            were used to direct the conduct of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and
            player pianos. However, their programs could not produce different behavior in
            response to some input or condition. Thousands of new languages has been
            invented, mainly in the computer field, and much more languages are still being
            created every year. Programming languages require computation to be described
            in an imperative form (i.e sequence of operations to perform) while other
            languages use other forms of program description such as the declarative form
            (i.e the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it.The description of a
            programming language is usually divided into the two components,i.e syntax and
            semantics. Some languages are defined by a identification document (for example, the
            Programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such

            could be a general-purpose computer programming language that‟s synchronous
            ,classbased ,object-orientated and specially designed to possess as few
            implementation dependencies as potential. It is considered as the perfect language for
            the developers and programmers to learn. The run time for compiling the program is
            1.89 sec and the memory used per second is 6.01mb.Currently, it’s the top-most
            programming language and has grabbed the very best position with Android OS yet
            again, though it was a bit down a few years ago. Java is used for mobile-based
            applications, enterprise-level purpose, for making desktop applications, and for
            establishing Android apps on tablets and Smartphone’s.
